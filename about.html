		<h2>About Edmond</h2>
		<div class = "one-half first">
			<p>I received my Master's in Business Analytics from the University of Arizona in May 2023. Throughout the last several years, I have developed a strong background in analytics through coursework, projects, and work experience. Likewise, I have a strong history of quality documentation and writing, evidenced through my code and writing examples.</p><br>
			<p>Strong communication skills and teamwork are a part of who I am, having worked on teams and group projects throughout my academic and professional career. Notably, my team for the Spring 2023 Business Consulting course--where we had to solve real business problems for clients--won the "Best Team" award out of approximately 17 total teams of master's students.</p><br>
			<p>Always working to hone my analytics skills further and learn more.</p>
